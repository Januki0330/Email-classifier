# Spam Email Classifier

Developed a machine learning-based spam email classifier using Python and the UCI Spambase dataset. Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to achieve ~95% F1-score in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Implemented two prediction methods: manual feature input using predefined 57-feature vectors and raw text processing with custom feature extraction (word frequencies, character counts, capital run analysis) built with regex and Python. Visualized model performance with a seaborn confusion matrix and packaged the project in a GitHub repository with clear documentation. Future enhancements include Gmail API integration for real-time email classification.

## Features
- **Training**: Multinomial Naive Bayes model trained on the UCI Spambase dataset, achieving ~95% F1-score.
- **Prediction Methods**:
  1. **Manual Feature Input**: Classify emails using predefined 57-feature vectors mimicking Spambase data.
  2. **Raw Text Processing**: Extract Spambase-compatible features from raw email text for prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Generates a confusion matrix and detailed metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Januki0330/spam-email-classifier.git
   cd spam-email-classifier


Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Required libraries include pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

2. **Download the Dataset**:

Download spambase.data from the UCI Spambase Dataset.
Place it in the data/ directory.

## Usage
1. **Train the Model**
Train the Naive Bayes model and save it as model.pkl:

```bash
python src/train.py
```
Outputs:
Performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
A confusion matrix saved as confusion_matrix.png in src/.

2. **Predict with Manual Feature Input**
Classify an email using a hardcoded 57-feature vector:

```bash

python src/predict_manual.py

```
Example: Sets word_freq_free to 1.0 and word_freq_money to 0.5 to simulate spam-like features.
Output: "Spam" or "Ham".

3. **Predict with Raw Text**
Process raw email text into Spambase features and classify:

```bash

python src/predict_text.py
```
Prompts you to enter email text (e.g., "Win a FREE iPhone NOW! Click here!!!").
Extracts features like word frequencies, character frequencies, and capital run lengths.
Output: The input text and its prediction ("Spam" or "Ham").

## Results

**Training Performance**:

Accuracy: ~95% on the Spambase test set.
F1-Score: ~0.95 for ham, ~0.89 for spam (exact values may vary slightly).
Evaluation Visualization: Check confusion_matrix.png in src/ for a graphical breakdown of predictions.

**How It Works**
Dataset: The UCI Spambase dataset contains 4601 email samples with 57 pre-extracted features (e.g., frequency of "free," "!", capital run lengths) and a binary label (0 = ham, 1 = spam).

Model: Multinomial Naive Bayes, chosen for its effectiveness with frequency-based data.

Manual Prediction: Uses a predefined 57-feature vector to match Spambase’s format.

Text Prediction: Custom feature extraction converts raw text into the 57 features required by the model, including word frequencies (e.g., "money"), character frequencies (e.g., "!"), and capital run statistics.

Example Output
Manual Prediction
```text
Prediction: Spam
Text Prediction
```
```text

Text Input: Win a FREE iPhone NOW! Click here!!!
Prediction: Spam
```

## Future Enhancements
API Integration: Add Gmail API or Microsoft Graph API to fetch and classify real emails from an inbox.

Model Comparison: Experiment with alternative algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or BERT).

Deployment: Create a Flask web app for an interactive demo of spam detection.

Improved Text Processing: Use NLP tools (e.g., NLTK stemming) for more accurate feature extraction.


**Requirements**
Python 3.6+
Dependencies listed in requirements.txt:
```text

pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## Installation Notes

Ensure spambase.data is in data/ before running train.py.
Run scripts from the project root or adjust file paths in the code if needed.

## Limitations

Text Prediction Accuracy: The raw text method approximates Spambase features, so real-world email performance may differ from the training dataset.

Static Features: Limited to the 57 features defined by Spambase (e.g., no URL detection or sender analysis yet).
